### Published Papers

- [Digital Knowledge Objects and Digital Knowledge Object Clusters: Unit
Holdings in a Learning Health System Knowledge Repository](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7427597) <i> The notion of a Knowledge Object is born in this early design paper. </i>

- [The Knowledge Object Reference Ontology (KORO): A formalism to support
management and sharing of computable biomedical knowledge for learning health systems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6508779/) <i> Knowledge Objects are formally defined for the first time here. </i>

- [Architecture and Initial Development of a Digital Library Platform for
Computable Knowledge Objects for Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423842) <i> Where are we going to put Knowledge Objects to manage them as resources? The need for a repository-archive is addressed here. </i>

- [Architecture and Initial Development of a Knowledge-as-a-Service Activator
 for Computable Knowledge Objects for Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677991) <i> How can we run the payloads in Knowledge Objects via APIs and webservices? The service-side component of KGrid - called an Activator - is described here. </i>

to Increase the Interoperability of Computable Biomedical Knowledge](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371244/) <i> Can Knowledge Objects be created automatically by extending an analytic pipeline? Yes, they can. This finding opens the door to analytics that immediately result in manageable resources and active webservices. </i>

### Papers Related to KGrid

#### Library Science

- [Digital Open Annotation with Hypothesis: Supplying the Missing Capability of the Web](https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/jsp.49.3.04)
<i> Here, the notion of open annotation for KGrid Knowledge Objects comes into play. </i>

- [Mobilizing Computable Biomedical Knowledge (CBK):A Manifesto
](https://medicine.umich.edu/sites/default/files/content/downloads/MCBK%20Manifesto%20Ver%2010.7.18.pdf) <i> The payoads of Knowledge Objects are CBK artifacts. It is CBK that needs to flow openly and freely to advance biomedicine and have Learning Health Systems. </i>

- [Mobilizing Computable Biomedical Knowledge for
Precision Medicine](https://precisionmedicine.duke.edu/sites/precisionmedicine.duke.edu/files/field/attachments/GPMF_Richesson.09.27.2018.pdf) <i> All precision medicine depends on machine-executable algorithms - CBK - to do required precisionizing. </i>

- [Stewardship in the “Age of Algorithm”](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/8097/6583) <i> The legal, social, and ethical impacts of algorithms must be considered. All CBK is biased and limited, and its biases and limits need to be well-understood. </i>

#### Informatics

- [A multi-layered framework for disseminating knowledge for
computer-based decision support](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/18/Supplement_1/i132/797073) <i> This paper describes four layers from L1, human-readable knowledge to L4, fully-deployed machine-executable knowledge.</i>

- [A “Fundamental Theorem” of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2649317/) <i> Changing an information space for a person is not the same as improving it. </i>

- [Ten Commandments for Effective Clinical Decision Support: Making the
Practice of Evidence-based Medicine a Reality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC264429/) <i> The domain of biomedical informatics is keenly interested in using CBK for CDS. KGrid and Knowledge Objects enable CDS via webservices, providing the potential for designated communities of all sorts to bring forward their expertise and knowledge in machine-executable forms. </i>

#### About Open Science

- [Evidence-Based Medicine in the EMR Era](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1108726) <i> An important story of analyzing available data in real-time to gain knowledge to inform a single medical decision. </i>

- [The unacknowledged convergence of open source, open access, and open science](https://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1265/1185) <i> The economics of the Knowledge Grid come into play in this article. </i>

- [Ushering in a New Era of Open Science Through Data Sharing](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1668313) <i> Where data sharing goes, we believe machine-executable knowledge sharing must follow. </i>

<i> KGrid generally focuses on machine-executable knowledge arising from analytic or deliberative data compression. </i>

- [Semantic information and the network theory of account](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-010-9821-4) 
<i> What does it take to upgrade information and arrive at knowledge? Try embedding information in a network so that it flows in such a way that correct answers to questions are provided. </i>

- [What is A Philosophical Question?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/meta.12035) 
<i> This paper categorizes knowledge as: observational, logico-mathematical, and noetic. KGrid focuses primarily on providing logico-mathematical answers using computable biomedical knowledge. </i>
