- [Ushering in a New Era of Open Science Through Data Sharing](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1668313)

- [Evidence-Based Medicine in the EMR Era](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1108726)

- [The science commons in health research: structure, function,
and value](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10961-006-9016-9)

#### Perspectives on Knoweldge

- [Big Data And New Knowledge In Medicine: The Thinking, Training, And
Tools Needed For A Learning Health System](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0053)

- [Desiderata for sharable computable biomedical knowledge for learning
health systems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lrh2.10065) 
<i>This paper highlights considerations that must be accounted for in order to share knowledge in machine-executable forms.</i>

- [Learning as Data Compression](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-73001-9_2) 
This paper points out that compressed data is a form of knowledge. KGrid generally focuses on machine-executable knowledge arising from analytic or deliberative data compression.

- [Semantic information and the network theory of account](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-010-9821-4) 
This paper describes what it takes to upgrade information and arrive at knowledge. What it takes is to embed information in a network in a manner that it can flow from a source to a target in such a way that correct answers to the target's questions are provided by the source. This perspective on knowledge highlights its relational nature by putting information networks into relief.

- [What is A Philosophical Question?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/meta.12035) 
This paper categorizes knowledge as three types of answers: observational, logico-mathematical, and noetic. KGrid focuses primarily on providing logico-mathematical answers by using computable knowledge.

Clinical Decision Support Consortium](http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/34506)
