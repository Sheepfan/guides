# Overview

By finishing this step-by-step tutorial, you should have built a bundled KO using KGRID CLI and the preferred text editor. The KO is built, tested, packaged and ready to be deployed and activated. The KO micro service API will be accessible through KGRID activator.

We will also discuss advanced topics relating with the concept and usage of Knowledge Objects.

## System requirements

As prerequisite, you have gone through the developer's guide. And your system has set up with following:

- [Node and NPM (version 10+)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Java 8+ JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [KGrid CLI](https://kgrid.org/kgrid-cli)

[The developer's guide](https://kgrid.org/guides/developer/) has shown you how to create a knowledge Object in the simplest form. You can modify, test, package and deploy the KO.

By running the KGrid Activator locally on your machine, you can activate the KO and provide KO service through RESTful API to the client.

Now, let's look into the SCORE model and build a KO in the bundled form.
