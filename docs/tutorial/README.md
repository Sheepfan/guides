# Overview

This tutorial will show you how to develop a Knowledge Object (KO) in the bundled form to compute 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on SCORE project.

We will also discuss advanced topics relating with the concept and usage of Knowledge Objects.

## System requirements

As prerequisite, you have gone through the developer's guide. And your system has set up with following:

- [Node and NPM (version 10+)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Java 8+ JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [KGrid CLI](https://kgrid.org/kgrid-cli)

##  Understand the basics

[The developer's guide](https://kgrid.org/guides/developer/) has shown you how to create a knowledge Object in the simple form. You can modify, test, package and deploy the KO.

By running the KGrid Activator locally on your machine, you can activate the KO and provide KO service through RESTful API to the client.

Now, let's look into the SCORE model and build the bundled KO.
